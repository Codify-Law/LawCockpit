                  I have a question about the service. I&apos;m interested in
                  learning more about the pricing plans and what features are
                  included in each tier.

                  I&apos;d be happy to explain our pricing plans. We offer three
                  tiers: Basic, Pro, and Enterprise. Each plan comes with
                  different features and capabilities. The Basic plan includes
                  essential features like chat support and basic analytics. The
                  Pro plan adds advanced reporting, API access, and priority
                  support. The Enterprise plan includes everything plus custom
                  integrations and dedicated account management. Would you like
                  me to elaborate on any specific plan?

                <p className="text-gray-100">
                  Yes, could you tell me more about the Pro plan? I&apos;m
                  particularly interested in the API access and what kind of
                  advanced reporting features are available.

                  The Pro plan&apos;s API access allows you to integrate our
                  services directly into your existing systems. You get up to
                  100,000 API calls per month, comprehensive documentation, and
                  access to our developer support team. As for advanced
                  reporting, you&apos;ll get detailed analytics on usage
                  patterns, custom dashboard creation, automated weekly/monthly
                  reports, and the ability to export data in multiple formats.
                  Would you like to see a demo of these features?

                  A demo would be great! Also, what&apos;s the pricing for the
                  Pro plan, and are there any current promotional offers?
